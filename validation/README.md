# Validation

This folder holds validation figures for each new CAPICE model.

If no X.X.X-final folder is supplied, consider the latest release candidate as final release.

## Allele Frequency plots

Please note the quotation marks around the very first allele frequency, "0".
These are samples that did not get an allele frequency when annotating with GnomAD, either due to no allele frequency being present or the allele frequency was not of high enough quality.
Most of these samples are singleton pathogenic variants, but they may very well contain higher allele frequency samples.
